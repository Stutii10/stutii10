## Hello !!! 👋

Hi, I’m Stuti Goyal, a rising senior studying Computer Science 💻 at the University of South Florida 🌴. I’m passionate about building meaningful solutions through code and constantly expanding my skill set—because for me, learning never really stops 👩🏻‍💻.

I’ve worked with languages like Python, C++, C, and Java, and have experience in web development using HTML, CSS, and React 🌐. I also explore data science and machine learning 📊 at a basic to intermediate level, and I’m comfortable with tools like Linux, Git, VS Code, and Hadoop 🔧.

Outside of tech, I’m a book lover 📚, a coffee enthusiast ☕ (it’s survival at this point), and a big fan of cricket 🏏.
